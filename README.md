# BaseCamp-Admission

This is an application that has an internal and external side.
The goal of this project is that it meets our client's needs whilst showing the group's technical ability.

# Internal Terminal

The internal use of this project allows a Base Camp Coding Academy member to view either a nomination, an application, or both.
This also allows the member to set up a first interview date.

# External Terminal

The external use of this project allows somebody to either nominate or apply to Base Camp Coding Academy.
The user is given the choice of which they want to do.


# How to use

The use of this program is fairly simple. When it comes to selecting what the user would like to do, prompted actions are displayed.
All they have to do is enter the number of what they would like to do. Then they will continue out the program while 
filling in the fields with the proper information.
